 ARL_EEGModels - A collection of Convolutional Neural Network models for EEG
 Signal Processing and Classification, using Keras and Tensorflow

 Requirements:
    (1) tensorflow == 2.X (as of this writing, 2.0 - 2.3 have been verified
        as working)
 
 To run the EEG/MEG ERP classification sample script, you will also need

    (4) mne >= 0.17.1

    (6) scikit-learn >= 0.20.1
    (7) matplotlib >= 2.2.3
    
 To use:
    
    (1) Place this file in the PYTHONPATH variable in your IDE (i.e.: Spyder)
    (2) Import the model as
        
        from EEGModels import EEGNet    
        
        model = EEGNet(nb_classes = ..., Chans = ..., Samples = ...)
        
    (3) Then compile and fit the model
    
        model.compile(loss = ..., optimizer = ..., metrics = ...)
        fitted    = model.fit(...)
        predicted = model.predict(...)
